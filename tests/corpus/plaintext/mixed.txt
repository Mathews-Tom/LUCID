This is a normal paragraph at the beginning of the document.

The following text resembles a bullet list but is plain text:
- Item one in a bullet-like format.
- Item two continues the pattern.
- Item three ends the pseudo-list.

Another paragraph follows the bullet-like content. The parser should
treat this entire section as prose since there is no structural markup
in plain text.
